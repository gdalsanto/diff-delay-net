# diff-delay-net
Implementation of the differentiable Delay Network presented by Sungho Lee et al. in their paper "Differentiable Artificial Reverberation"

### WORK IN PROGRESS 
Please note that this implementation is my interpretation of the architecture presented in 
[Lee, S., Choi, H. S., & Lee, K. (2022). Differentiable artificial reverberation. IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing, 30, 2541-2556.`](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9837411). Currently, it is undergoing testing and debugging, which may result in further modifications.
